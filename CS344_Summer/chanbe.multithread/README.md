At the moment, this code has a 75% success rate. If it fails to execute correctly on the first try, re-run a couple of times.  
Interestingly, the code has a 98% success rate when printing debugging information. This can be done by running the code with the parameter '1'.  
  
To run normally:  
> $ line_processor 1 < input1.txt > output1.txt  
  
To run with debugging info:  
> $ line_processor 1 < input1.txt > output1.txt
